    <h1>A Love So True</h1>
    <center>
    <p>Her smile is a work of art, exquisite and true,</p>
    <p>A vision of beauty that captures my heart anew,</p>
    <p>Her lips curve upwards in a perfect arc,</p>
    <p>A smile that's so radiant, it lights up the dark.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Her laugh is elegant, a sound that's so pure,</p>
    <p>Like a melody that's perfect, in rhythm and allure,</p>
    <p>It lifts me up, fills me with pure delight,</p>
    <p>A symphony of joy that banishes the night.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Her face, a vision of loveliness untold,</p>
    <p>A sight to behold, that never grows old,</p>
    <p>Her features, so pretty, are a work of art,</p>
    <p>A masterpiece that captures my heart.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Her nose, so fine and perfectly defined,</p>
    <p>A feature that complements her face, so kind,</p>
    <p>Her eyes, so pretty, they shine bright and true,</p>
    <p>A window to her soul, reflecting all that's pure.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Her speech is innocent, a voice so sweet,</p>
    <p>A sound that's so gentle, it's like a treat,</p>
    <p>Her words, so pure, full of love and grace,</p>
    <p>A heart that's pure, with a radiant face.</p>
    <br>
    <p>All these things make her so special to me,</p>
    <p>A love that's true, that's pure and free,</p>
    <p>With her by my side, my heart is complete,</p>
    <p>Forever in love, forever at peace.</p>
    </center>
